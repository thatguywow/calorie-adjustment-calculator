Calorie Adjustment Calculator

​A simple, data-driven calculator that helps you make precise, weekly adjustments to your calorie intake based on your actual weight trends. This tool is designed to provide a more accurate and personalized approach to achieving your weight loss, gain, or maintenance goals.

​The Problem:
​Most online calorie calculators use static formulas (like TDEE) to provide an estimated calorie target. These estimates often fail to account for individual metabolic differences, leading to frustrating plateaus and inaccurate results.
​This calculator solves that problem by using your own data to create a dynamic feedback loop.

​Key Features:
​Data-Driven Adjustments: Provides calorie recommendations based on your unique metabolism and weekly weight change, not a generic formula.
​Weekly Median Weights: Uses a feedback system based on the median of your weekly weight, effectively smoothing out daily fluctuations from water, glycogen, and food to provide a more accurate trend.
​Local Storage: All logged weight data is stored securely in your browser's local cache, ensuring your information remains completely private.
​Clear, Actionable Results: Gives you a single, precise number to adjust your daily calories by, taking the guesswork out of your nutrition plan.
​Support for All Goals: Separate formulas for weight loss, gain, and maintenance to ensure optimal results.

​How to Use:
​Input your current daily calorie intake.
​Enter your previous week's median weight and your new weekly weight from today.
​Select your goal (loss, gain, or maintenance).
​The calculator will provide a new calorie target to help you get closer to your goal.
